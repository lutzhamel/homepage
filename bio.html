<b>Dr. Lutz Hamel</b><br>
Associate Professor in Computer Science<br>

<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Oxford University, UK,
an MS in Computer Science
from the University of New Hampshire and a BS in Electrical Engineering
from the University of
Rhode Island.


<h3>Scientist, Author, Musician, Luthier, and Animal Welfare Advocate</h3>

<p>
  As a <b>scientist</b>I am interested  in machine learning, deep learning and data science in general.
  For the past couple of years I have been investigating neural networks
  for unsupervised learning called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">self-organizing maps</a>.
  I am particularly
  interested in quality measures and stopping criteria for this learning
  algorithm.  Recently I started investigating deep neural maps which are a deep learning extension of
  self-organizing maps.

  I am also interested in the semantics and implementation of
programming languages.
I recently designed a programming language called Asteroid around the new
pattern-matching oriented programming paradigm. An experimental implementation of Asteroid can
be found <a href="https://github.com/lutzhamel/asteroid">here</a>.



<p>
As an <b>author</b> I published a <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470371927.html">book on machine learning using support vector
machines</a>
and more recently I am working on a book on programming language
implementation under contract by <a href="http://fbeedle.com">Franklin, Beedle & Associates
Publishing</a>.  This book takes a very modern approach to
programming language implementation in the sense that interpreters,
compilers, and virtual machines are all given equal weight in terms of
being valid implementation strategies for programming languages.
You can find a draft of the book <a href="https://github.com/lutzhamel/plipy">here</a>.

<p>
As a <b>musician</b> I am mostly interested in Americana and American Roots
music and some of its modern interpretations, think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Earle">Steve Earle</a>
or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Power">Cat Power</a>.
My instruments: fiddle, five string
banjo, mandolin, guitar.

<p>
As a <b>luthier</b> I build and restore stringed instruments; mostly violins
but also parlor guitars, banjos, and mandolins.
You can follow my adventures in
instrument building and restoration on my <a href="http://hilmarhanssoninstruments.blogspot.com">blog</a> under my Icelandic alter
ego Hilmar Hansson.

<p>
As an <b>animal welfare advocate</b> I have been involved with rescue horses
for the better part of the past decade through the horse rescue and
sanctuary called <a href="https://horseplayrescue.org">Horse Play</a>.  We also foster rescue
horses on our farm in western Rhode Island.
